                    <p>Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:

                        (If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this
                        class.

                        (If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions
                        on how
                        to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on
                        GitHub
                        Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.

                        Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to
                        this
                        assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module3-solution or mod3_solution,
                        etc.
                        Create an index.html file inside the solution container folder, e.g.,
                        module3-solution/index.html.

                        The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown
                        below.
                        You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menu
                        dropdown
                        shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating a single,
                        responsive page.

                        Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into
                        a css
                        folder under the solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/css.

                        For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. I
                        suggest you
                        start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If
                        you've
                        cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the examples/Lecture25 folder.
                        Copy the
                        contents of examples/Lecture25 to your solution container folder (e.g., module3-solution) as a
                        starting
                        point..

                        Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, I will
                        define our
                        desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., md, sm, and
                        xs.

                        Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
                        Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
                        Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes
                        Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become
                        invisible and
                        is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name
                        (i.e.,
                        navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See
                        . Make the browser window narrower to see
                        the mobile
                        menu button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)

                        For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons
                        should be
                        visible. (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class.)

                        Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that
                        button,
                        a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The
                        dropdown menu
                        should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

                        The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make sure the dropdown
                        menu has
                        a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.

                        (Hint: See  and Lecture 31 for examples on
                        how to
                        accomplish this.)

                        Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window.
                        You must
                        use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.

                        (Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see.)

                            dropdown menu has
                            a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.

                            (Hint: See and Lecture 31 for examples
                            on how to
                            accomplish this.)

                            Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser
                            window. You must
                            use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.

                            (Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see.)
