      <h3>John Hondronikolis</h3>
      <h6>Inside Sales / Customer Service</h6>
      <p>My career path at Serva-Lite Sales started in 2006 working in the warehouse as a shipper and receiver. I discovered fairly quickly that life safety products interested me and I wanted to continue my path learning the products we sell to Fire Safety and Electrical Companies. As I continued to gain more experience and product knowledge I decided in 2016 to take on a new roll within the company and joined the sales team as an inside sales member. This move has been great and I always look to challenge myself everyday to help our customers needs.<br>
      Since the company has become a division of Steel Fire Equipment Ltd. we have increased our SKU numbers significantly now. Serva-Lite Sales has expanded and has become a very important part of the industry and the future looks bright.<br>      
      I was born and raised in Vancouver and enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I continue to enjoy sports, fishing and travelling in my spare time. You can always catch me discussing Football and Hockey any day of the week. I’m waiting for that day the Vancouver Canucks will hoist the Cup.
